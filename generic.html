									<p>When I had turned six years old my uncle had gifted me a Gameboy Silver. I remember spending countless hours playing classic titles like Tak and the Power of Juju and Crash bandicoot. As technologies began to improve and studios began creating the next generation of games for consoles, I fell in love with First and Third Person shooters as well as single player action adventure games. The experiences I had with these titles propelled me to explore a career in digital art and work with a creative studio to build the next wave of games for everyone to enjoy. Along this journey, I have been grateful enough to have traveled to some truly spectacular places around the country and internationally. I love to see innovation in design and how culture can influence a physical environments presence for people to explore whether man made or completely natural. </p>

								<p>After completing highschool, I applied to the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University to pursue a degree in Nanoscience and try out for their Wrestling team. I had worked very hard academically and even made the team my first semester, but came to realize I desperately needed to change majors. I came across a brand new major titled "Creative Technologies". After further research I decided to switch upon finising my first semester. Since then, I have worked consistenly to improve my artwork and one day work at a studio of my dreams.</p>

								<h4>Personal Life</h4>
								<p>Besides working on the computer, I have been involved with mixed martial arts and wrestling since I was 6 years old. This allowed me to thrive under pressure and remain determined when working towards my goals. I enjoy speaking about philosophy and scientific theories about evolution and ancient history. I love to scuba dive, play sand volleyball, and hike in the summer. Just being outside in general brings me lots of joy. I am a huge fan of Paulo Coehlo's many books and love to read when ever I find some down time. Although I do focus mainly in digital creation, I do thoroughly enjoy experimenting with sculpture work and creating art from every day objects.   </p>

								<p>I am very personable and love to connect with other artists and individuals who enjoy 3D art. As I progress through my career I eventually one day would like to be an Art Director or Storyline creator at a talented studio, working with some of the best in the business. Until then, I am actively seeking employment and work opportunites that can further progress my art work through the eyes of millions.  </p>
