								<h3>Origins
								</h3>
								<div class="row" style="padding-bottom: 20px;"> 
									<div id="para" class="col-7 "> 
									<p>I had always known about my interests in art and design growing up, but had very few direct outlets towards that type of creativity. With the new era of 3D games releasing as I began to grow older, I was asking questions I am still answering day by day as I learn and grow as a 3D artist. I never could have imagined what goes into the creation of a video game or animated movie as a child, but as a recent college graduate seeking employment in the industry, I am nothing short of excited to begin my career. My portfolio so far is a mix of client work and personal projects that both entertain and educate. I am very passionate about collaborating with others to solve real world problems using a wide array of Creative Technologies. </p>

								<h4>Personal Life</h4>
								<p>Besides working on the computer, I have been involved with mixed martial arts and wrestling since I was 6 years old. This allowed me to thrive under pressure and remain determined when working towards my goals. I enjoy speaking about philosophy and scientific theories about evolution and ancient history. I love to scuba dive, play sand volleyball, and hike in the summer. Just being outside in general brings me lots of joy. I am a huge fan of Paulo Coehlo's many books and love to read when ever I find some down time. Although I do focus mainly in digital creation, I do thoroughly enjoy experimenting with sculpture work and creating art from every day objects.As I progress through my career I am actively seeking employment and work opportunites that can further progress my artist knowledge and skills.  </p>
